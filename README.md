## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required software
Node.js >= 16.0.0
TypeScript >= 4.5.0
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/documentation-engine.git

# Install dependencies
cd documentation-engine
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { DocumentationEngine } from './src/engine';

// Initialize the engine with configuration
const engine = new DocumentationEngine({
    security: {
        enableSensitiveDataDetection: true,
        auditLogging: true
    },
    performance: {
        cacheEnabled: true,
        maxConcurrency: 4
    }
});

// Generate documentation for a code block
const documentation = await engine.generateDocumentation({
    content: sourceCode,
    language: 'typescript',
    location: {
        filePath: 'src/example.ts',
        startLine: 1,
        endLine: 100
    }
});
```

## Configuration

### Security Configuration
```typescript
{
    "security": {
        "sensitivePatterns": ["password", "secret", "key"],
        "encryptionKey": "your-encryption-key",
        "auditConfig": {
            "enabled": true,
            "logLevel": "info"
        }
    }
}
```

### Performance Configuration
```typescript
{
    "performance": {
        "maxConcurrency": 4,
        "cacheSize": 1000,
        "timeoutMs": 5000
    }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Pattern Detection
The engine supports detection of common design patterns:
- Factory Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Command Pattern
- And more...

### Template Customization
```typescript
// Register a custom template
engine.templateManager.registerTemplate('function', new Template(
    '/**\n' +
    ' * {description}\n' +
    ' * @param {parameterDocs}\n' +
    ' * @returns {returnDocs}\n' +
    ' */\n'
));
```

### Continuous Improvement
The system includes built-in mechanisms for:
- Regular updates and maintenance
- User feedback collection and analysis
- Community engagement
- Feature roadmap management
